# Technical Context for the Lunch Ordering System

## Technologies Used
1. **Frontend**: 
   - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the user interface.
   - Frameworks such as React or Vue.js may be considered for a more dynamic experience.

2. **Backend**: 
   - Node.js with Express for handling server-side logic and API requests.
   - A simple RESTful API will be implemented to manage communication between the frontend and backend.

3. **Database**: 
   - A lightweight database such as SQLite or a NoSQL database like MongoDB for storing user orders and menu items.

## Technical Constraints
- The system must be able to handle multiple simultaneous user requests efficiently.
- The database should support quick read and write operations to ensure a smooth user experience.
- The application should be designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.

## Development Environment
- The project will be developed using Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE.
- Version control will be managed using Git, with a repository hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.
