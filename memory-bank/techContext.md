# Technical Context for the Lunch Ordering System

## Technologies Used
1. **Frontend**: 
   - Blazor for building the user interface, providing a modern and interactive experience.

2. **Backend**: 
   - C# with ASP.NET for handling server-side logic and API requests.
   - A simple RESTful API will be implemented to manage communication between the frontend and backend.

3. **Database**: 
   - Supabase as the database for storing user orders and menu items, providing a scalable and efficient solution.

## Technical Constraints
- The system must be able to handle multiple simultaneous user requests efficiently.
- The database should support quick read and write operations to ensure a smooth user experience.
- The application should be designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.

## Mobile-First Design
- The Lunch Ordering System will be developed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the user interface is responsive and provides an optimal experience on mobile devices before scaling up to larger screens.

### Blazor Project Structure
A typical Blazor project structure includes the following components:

```
/BlazorProject
│
├── /Components          # Reusable components
│   ├── _Imports.razor   # Common imports for components
│   ├── App.razor        # Main application component
│   ├── Layout/          # Layout components
│   │   ├── MainLayout.razor
│   │   └── NavMenu.razor
│   ├── Pages/           # Page components
│   │   ├── Counter.razor
│   │   ├── Error.razor
│   │   ├── Home.razor
│   │   └── Weather.razor
│   └── Services/        # Services for data access
│       └── SupabaseService.cs
│
├── /wwwroot             # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
│   ├── app.css
│   ├── favicon.png
│   └── bootstrap/       # Bootstrap files
│       ├── bootstrap.min.css
│       └── bootstrap.min.css.map
│
├── appsettings.json     # Configuration settings
├── BlazorProject.csproj # Project file
├── Program.cs           # Entry point for the application
└── launchSettings.json   # Launch settings for development
```

This structure helps maintain organization and clarity within the project, making it easier to manage components, services, and static assets.
- The project will be developed using Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE.
- Version control will be managed using Git, with a repository hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.
