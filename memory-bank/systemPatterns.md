# System Patterns for the Lunch Ordering System

## Architecture Overview
The Lunch Ordering System follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend user interface communicates with the backend server to process orders and manage the menu.

## Design Patterns
1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: 
   - The system will implement the MVC pattern to separate concerns between the user interface (View), the business logic (Controller), and the data management (Model).

2. **Singleton Pattern**: 
   - The backend server will utilize the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the server is running, managing all incoming requests efficiently.

3. **Observer Pattern**: 
   - The system will use the Observer pattern to notify users of changes in the menu or order status, providing real-time updates.

## Data Flow
- Users interact with the frontend to place orders.
- The frontend sends requests to the backend server.
- The backend processes the requests, interacts with the database, and sends responses back to the frontend.
